# AI-Powered-Phishing-Financial-Fraud-Detection-Platform

As digital payments, online banking, and e-governance rapidly expand, citizens and small businesses face growing threats from phishing, identity theft, and financial fraud. These attacks often bypass traditional security systems, leading to financial loss and loss of trust in digital platforms. Existing solutions are either too rigid or generate excessive false alarms. 

The project offers an intelligent and adaptive approach by using machine learning to detect fraudulent emails, malicious URLs, and suspicious financial transactions in real time. It analyzes user behavior, transaction patterns, and email content to generate risk scores with clear explanations, enabling quick actions such as blocking or multi-factor authentication. By being scalable, transparent, and continuously learning, it strengthens cyber trust for citizens, SMEs, and governments.
